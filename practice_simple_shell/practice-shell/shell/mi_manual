.SH DESCRIPTION

The (hsh) is the outermost layer of the operating system. It includes a programming language for controlling files and processes, as well as starting and controlling other programs. The hsh manages communication between the user and the operating system, requesting input, interpreting this input for the operating system, and handling any output results from the operating system.

$PATH = /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin

-Overview
simple_shell is a shell emulator that reads lines from standard input, interprets them and, in general, executes them .

 -Argument -list -processing
hsh reads a entire line, and assumed that the first argument read from standard input is the command and following arguments are it's parameters.

EXIT STATUS
Exit status is the return of the last command executed on simple_shell, if the last command is successfull then return zero, otherwise return the macro defined EXIT_FAILURE.

Environment
This simple_shell only works with the ENV (enviroment) variable, that is an array of strings, wich contains the path to programs or files that shell uses, by convention these strings have the form 'name=value', are separated by ':'.
